PURPOSE

    SearchLog is a search engine meant to provide high-usability and
    powerful access to documents being searched. It does not search the web,
    but local files provided to it. It is meant to help the user find materials
    quickly.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

    Basics

        * To install, run "./install" and answer the questions provided.  This
          will run a Unix-flavor install-style script and should create a
          working, out-of-the-box installation when supplied appropriate
          values.

        * See USAGE below if are curions about how to use SearchLog.

        Setup and Customization

            The Configure link at the bottom of SearchLog search page
            provides a menu you can use to customize the data mine. It can be
            private, publicly readable, or publicly readable and writable.

            The main engine is intended for anyone to be able to use; the setup
            pages are slightly more technical.

        Security

            The present release of SearchLog has not been closely
            scrutinized for security, and should be treated as such by
            security-conscious administrators.  If you discover a
            vulnerability, please contact the author at
            jonathan.hayward@pobox.com with details.

            You are strongly encouraged to change the password in
            /usr/share/searchlog/password.

            The default installation sets
            /usr/share/searchlog and contents
            to a relatively permissive mode.  Administrators are encouraged to
            set directory and contents to mode 700, owned by the
            effective user ID that CGI scripts will be running under. This
            is usually apache or nobody.

USAGE

    SearchLog is designed to be run as a straightforward web
    application, with much administrative activity performed on-web.
    Once it is set up via the Configure link, just explore.

        http://[your hostname]/cgi-bin/searchlog

    (That is the location provided by RPM installation and the default for the
    provided installer. The provided installer allows you to specify another
    location; if you specified another location, substitute that for
    "/cgi-bin/furball".)
