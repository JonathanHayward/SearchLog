<p>What is SearchLog?</p>

<p>SearchLog combines a weblog with a search engine. Actually, it's much more
powerful than that. It can function as a personal information management tool
and portal, and can keep track of ideas and both personal and group
information. Searchlog is designed to be user-friendly in mind and uses
features like highlighting and easy linking between entries to try to give the
user maximum power for minimum effort.</p>
