<!-- field_Text SearchLog is meant to store information and give you, and possibly your visitors, powerful access to it. You can configure it to be private, or something other people can read, or something other people can read and add material to. In other words, it can be your private tool, or a weblog, or a public collaboration tool. It's like a sheet of paper: you can write whatever you want on it.

The two halves of the screen do different jobs. The left side is for searching and finding things in here, and the right side is for reading them (and making changes).

The easiest way to discover what the features are is to play around. See what the features are. Find out how you can use it best. -->
